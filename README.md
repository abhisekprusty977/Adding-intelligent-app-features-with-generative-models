# Adding-intelligent-app-features-with-generative-models
This sample project shows how to integrate generative AI capabilities into an app using the Foundation Models framework. The sample app showcases intelligent trip planning features that help people discover landmarks and generate personalized itineraries.
The app creates an interactive experience where people can:
Browse curated landmarks with rich visual content,
Generate trip itineraries tailored to a chosen landmark,
Discover points of interest using a custom tool,
Experience real-time content generation with streaming responses.
